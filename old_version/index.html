                                You might be wondering what exactly GwM is, and what it is that I have set out to do. This website is a melange of my skills and training as a counsellor, doctor, and yoga instructor. Through this website and service portal, I want to reach out to anyone who might be going through a difficult time in their life: from people experiencing friction in family relationships that cause an uneasy home environment, to people experiencing problems that have upended their daily routine, I have you covered. <br><br>
                                Through a unique style of informal and intimate conversation, ‘guftgu’, we can talk about the issues bothering you, and work towards achieving a solution. This may take the form of counselling therapy, yoga and chakra therapy, or further recommendations to specialists, if needed. <br><br>
                                I believe that pain cannot be avoided, and help should not be. So let’s get started on your journey towards healing.
