                    Middle-age is full of changes that feel hard to accept. You might be having troubles coming to terms with your children growing up and leaving home, and if you are going through perimenopause, your body might be experiencing several changes that seem unfamiliar and unpredictable. Consequently, in trying to deal with these changes, your personal life may have taken a toll.<br>If so, I can help— be it through counselling aimed at dealing with loneliness, relationships, and body dysmorphia, or by answering any general queries you may have about menopause.

                    Parenthood is a constant struggle— especially when it’s new. You want to protect your child from all harm, but sometimes it can be difficult to know what the cause of the harm is. Insecurity, difficulty in adapting to new environments, and learning disabilities, can all cause concerning changes in your child’s behaviour, both at home and at school.<br>With my specialisation in parental therapy, I can work with you to understand what issues your child might be facing, and how to resolve them.

                    Marriage isn’t always easy; even though love between spouses begets happiness and trust, a relationship can still be vulnerable to a host of problems ranging from infertility to infidelity. You may love your spouse, but feel estranged from them due to an overbearing interference from your parents and in-laws, or you might want to leave them, but feel afraid of voicing your feelings.<br>As a specialist in family therapy, I can help you communicate with your partner about several issues you may not want to face alone, like conception, domestic and emotional abuse, family problems, and separation.

                    Pregnancy brings with it a host of joy and uncertainty. You might have several questions about pregnancy and childbirth that you want to discuss at length, or that you want to talk about informally. As an ultrasonologist, I can advise you on your concerns, and guide you towards relevant resources and information.<br>Note: the information I provide should not be taken as the final authority. Please consult your doctor before making any decisions.

                <p class="text">
                    Puberty is a time fraught with changes and questions for both parents and children. While children gain new information and have questions about sex, bodily changes, and their development of secondary sexual characteristics, parents are left questioning how to have frank conversations on these topics, which are generally considered taboo in Indian society. I can help parents navigate these tricky topics, and inform both children and their guardians about the importance of proper knowledge about sex, methods of protection, puberty, and the changes it brings.

                    For something that about half the population deals with on a monthly basis, periods are some of the most frequently misunderstood and taboo physiological processes. If your menstruation cycle has started recently, or your periods have been unusually irregular or painful, I can help by answering any questions you may have about the process, and giving a detailed explanation of what our bodies go through every month. I can also answer questions about various sanitary products like pads, tampons, cups, etc. and their proper care and disposal. 
                    <br>At the other end of the spectrum, if you’re a woman experiencing the onset of menopause, and are going through a varying libido, mood swings, having sudden chills or hot flashes, I can give you the resources and knowledge needed to move through this tricky time in life.

I can also help identify if you are facing any major health issue, and give you temporary relief remedies before you ultimately visit your doctor. Further, if you have any queries about your doctoral reports, or are unable to understand report findings, I can answer them and even direct you to other specialists if needed.

                <p class="text">
                    A part of yoga deals with the balancing of chakras, which are energy forms located in seven places straight down the head and spine. These chakras are said to align our physical and astral bodies, and any blockage in the flow of these energies can disturb one’s physical and emotional well-being. Chronic pain and health issues in certain areas of the body, and uneven temperaments signal a potential block in one or more chakras. Through a change in diet, specific asanas, and various other methods, I can help in opening any blocked chakras.

            <div class="content__text-box">
                <p class="text">
                    Along with asanas, I will also teach you how to do a lymphatic massage. Lymph is a fluid in our body that carries infection-fighting white blood cells, and circulates these cells throughout our body to maintain immunity and health. With age, this circulation slows down, and can form concentrated nodes. A lymphatic massage increases the flow of lymphs, and helps our bodies fight illness better.

                <p class="text">
                    Yoga is more than just doing asanas to improve one’s physical well-being. It also includes exercises and habits that promote mental and spiritual health. Mindfulness is one such exercise, in which one makes the conscious effort to be present in, and aware of all sensations and emotions within oneself. This allows us to become aware of any repressed pain or emotions, which we can then begin to let go in a step towards spiritual healing. I can also help you explore mind-body connections, to work out how certain attitudes, beliefs, and emotions can have positive or negative impacts on physical health.
